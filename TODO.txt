=== Internal proofs
- Include the hash of the VB state in the VB radix tree
--> So that the node can prove the current state without having to serve the entire VB.

=== Accounts
- Add a section for a public key renewal
--> Allows a user to keep the same account with a new key pair if he/she suspects that its private key has been exposed.
